I love designing electronics that perform safety critical missions.

In 2010 I led the team at the RIT Amateur Radio Club [(K2GXT)](https://www.rit.edu/sg/amateurradioclub/) in designing 
a high altitude balloon that ascended to over [97,000](https://www.flickr.com/photos/62621941@N02/sets/72157626674875178/) feet above Rochester, NY. 

For nearly the next 5 years I was a Hardware Development Engineer at [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com) designing, building, and qualifying electronics and assemblies that flew into space on both the
 Falcon 9 rocket and both Dragon capsules.
 
In 2018 I joined [Reliable Robotics](http://www.reliable.co) building large autonomous aircraft focusing on the Part 23 aircraft industry. 

I worked with my brother on our personal side company [FaradayRF](https://github.com/FaradayRF) that designed and sold digital radio's for use in the 
Part 97 amateur radio spectrum. I've shelved this work for now to focus my energy on Reliable Robotics.

### Outside of Work

I'm an avid rocker climber and mountaineer with a tendency to bring along a camera. 

I am driven more by the journey, the planning process, the learning process, and the wilderness experience than the achievements of climbing. This has guided me in learning skills and the partners I adventure with. Exploring the outdoors safely and within my own personal/partner achievements and new skillsets are primary drivers.
